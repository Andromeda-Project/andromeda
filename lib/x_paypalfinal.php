        <h1>Paypal Success Page</h1>
        <p>This is the framework default page that shows
        that Paypal completed.
        </p>
        
        <p>You need to make a new file called x_paypal_final.php,
        in your application directory that does what your app 
        wants.  You can start by copying this file from the lib
        directory.
