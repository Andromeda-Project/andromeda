Andromeda
=============

Andromeda is a programmer productivity tool, our only measure of success is how much we can reduce labor and increase quality. We want to help you to get it done, get it right.

Andromeda's primary unique feature is our incredibly powerful data dictionary, which allows you to radically apply the D-R-Y (don't repeat yourself) principle when creating applications. This feature is not present in any other framework that we have found, and it will change the way you work on projects that require powerful database features.

The Andromeda philosophy is to help or get out of the way. Andromeda has features to speed up accurate development at the database level, PHP level, and in the browser, but the programmer can always 'escape the box' without fear of a dictorial framework.
